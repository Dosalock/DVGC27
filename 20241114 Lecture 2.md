# Lecture 2 - Learning

* Unsupervised
* Semi-supervised
  * label groups of objects
* Reinforcement learning
  * Agents in an enviroment
  * Loop:
    * Agen takes action
    * a reward func is calculated
    * new state + reward is given to agent

## Basics

* When we train we only see a subset of the real data

How to solve? More data!


## Function approximator

* Machine learning tries to approx a function that reflects reality
  * func is unknown
  * our ML mechanism needs to be powerful enouhg ot reflect this
* supervised learning:
  * We have some labeled data (x,y)
* input data has variance
  * we need enough labeled data
  * problem is we can only do straight lines but this function is a curve

## What reduces real performance

#### Algorithm

* Wrong algo
  * ML-algo or Model with not enough expansiveness
  * model too small

#### Data

* not enough data
  * more is better
* Noise
  * e.g. a picture of two animals of different breeds but 1 tag
* biased data
* wrong labeled data
* choosing bad labels
  * red and green but no blue label

**Hyperparameters** - how the model learns/trains

#### Training

* Underfitting
  * not enough training
* Overfitting
  * too much focus on the trainin set
  * can hapen when training too long
  * mean it does not generalize well
    * it overperforms on the training set but underperform on validation set
  * Valiation set is needed to detect it
  * (test set is needed to detect overfitting validation set)
